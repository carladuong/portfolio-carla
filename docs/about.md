# About Me

Hi! My name is **Carla Duong**, and I'm a senior majoring in 6-2. I was born and raised in southern California, but I've loved living in Massachusetts over the last three years. Outside of class, I'm very interested in fashion and making my own clothes.

Most of my coursework so far has involved backend work, so in 6.1040, I'm excited to learn more about the frontend and how to give users of my projects a great experience.
