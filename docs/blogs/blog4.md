# Response to Claire Chen's L15 Blog

Original blog: https://clairejc.github.io/portfolio-clairejc/blogs/blog3.html

Claire brought up some great points in her blog about finding a balance between appeasing stakeholders who value growth and those who value ethics. I 100% agree that the solution is to anchor a company in its ethics from the start and to attract stakeholders who also share the same values. 

One part of Claire’s blog post that stuck out to me was the following quote: “Prioritizing short term gains over long term values brings up an important question to consider: How can companies stay true to their ethics while pushing for growth?”

I would like to add that for many business decisions, prioritizing long term-values over short-term gains can also lead to long-term gains. One example I can think of is when Patagonia, an environmentally-conscious outdoor clothing company, refused to make custom logo gear for certain companies that did not align with their values of sustainability, such as oil and gas companies. Although this would have been an opportunity for them to make a large profit, they chose to stand by their ethical values. As a result of reiterating their commitment to sustainability, the trust and loyalty of their environmentally-conscious customers was strengthened. Since then, the company has only grown, becoming more attractive to younger consumers who are often more concerned about the planet.

Consumers today are more aware than ever of what they are indirectly supporting by purchasing from brands. As Lyel mentioned, when a company stays true to their values, they can grow while pleasing their employees, customers, and stakeholders. Claire, thank you so much for your insightful blog!
