# Outfinity Feedback

Although I loved everybody’s app concepts and I thought that they were all solving important problems, the Phoenixes presented my favorite pitch of the day! As somebody who is very interested in both fashion and sustainability, I’ve been trying to find an outfit logging app to make full use of the clothes I already own for years, but have never found one that I was completely happy with. A large part of this is due to the problem that the Phoenixes mentioned in their presentation, which is that many outfit logging apps I’ve tried are also meant to function as shopping apps, which defeats the purpose of consuming less.

With the goal of sustainability in mind, I think it’d also be helpful to encourage users to follow the “30 wear rule” (the commitment to wearing a new piece of clothing at least 30 times) by allowing users to see how many times they’ve worn a particular piece, and perhaps having a meter displaying their progress towards 30 wears. I also think it’d be interesting to include inspiration on how to wear different pieces of clothing in unusual ways to get even more use out of them. For example, I’ve seen people style long sleeve dress shirts as vests, halter tops, crop tops, and more by buttoning them or tying them differently, which I think is a great way to make your closet seem bigger than it really is.

Regardless of whether they include these ideas or not, I’m really excited to see what the Phoenixes end up doing with their fun, novel app concept!
