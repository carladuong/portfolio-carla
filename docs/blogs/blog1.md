# CSC GO Interaction Design

In lecture 11, we discussed how physical and linguistic heuristics can make a product easier to use, and conversely how violating conventions can make the product unintuitive. For this blog post, I wanted to apply some of the ideas we learned to analyze the control panels on the CSC GO washers and dryers that can be found in MIT dorms, and to determine which parts of the design are effective and which are ineffective.

In class we discussed the Gestalt principles of grouping, and how the same objects can be separated into groups to convey structure and relatedness. In the washer control panel above, we can see that the options for each setting are in labeled rows, and that they are partitioned by white lines to make the separation clearer. This helps the user understand that each row is a different quality, and they are meant to choose one setting from each row. The icons for each button are also intuitive-- for example, a new user who doesn't know the difference between deluxe and ultra can clearly see that ultra will result in a more intense clean. However, a flaw that I can see is also related to grouping. If the indicator light for the deluxe wash were on, it could be difficult to see if the regular or the deluxe wash was selected because the light is only slightly closer to the deluxe button than the regular. To fix this design, I would space out the buttons more (keeping the same amount of space between a button and its respective light) so that a user is less likely to associate a light with the wrong button.

The dryer control panel above has the same problem as the washer with the indicator lights. Though I've used the dryer dozens of times, I still have to double check when I select low temp to ensure that I did not accidentally select high temp, since this would ruin my clothes. Like the car radio example, this design is not error-tolerant, as there is no way to check what temperature you've selected (other than the light) until the cycle is finished. Another awkward aspect of the design results from a violation of conventions at the linguistic level. Reading instinctively from left to right, top to bottom, the order of the buttons is [high, low, no heat, medium, delicate], which is unintuitive given that a convention on similar machines would be to order the temperature settings from low to high. Having delicate as an option along with the heat settings could also be confusing, since on the washer, the delicate option was separate from the temperature options. To improve upon the design, I might organize all of the buttons (except for the start button) into a single column so it is more clear that the user is meant to choose one setting, and I would order them from lowest to highest temperature so that it aligns more closely with established conventions.
