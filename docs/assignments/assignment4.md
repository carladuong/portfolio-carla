## Code and Deployment
The GitHub repo with my backend code can be found [here](https://github.com/carladuong/ginger), and the deployment can be found [here](ginger-kappa.vercel.app). If the deployment link doesn't work, please try going to this website: ginger-kappa.vercel.app


## Design Reflection
While implementing my backend service, I realized that the abstract data models that I had originally designed for some of my concepts were too complex or infeasible in practice. For example, my original Messaging concept involved a type called Chat, which would map to a set of objects of type Message. These nested types were clunky to implement in practice, and because of this I had to simplify my abstract data model so that the Messaging concept was responsible for a set of Chats and a separate set of Messages. 

Another example was my Matching concept. I originally planned to implement the matching behavior as an action within the Matching concept, but because users are matched based on the communities that they are a part of (i.e. the Labels they assign themselves), I realized that the matching behavior would be more feasible to implement if I could use methods that belonged to the Labeling concept. Because of this, I simplified the Matching concept so that it just handled the pairing of two entities, and I synchronized Matching and Labeling to implement the matching behavior.

Perhaps the most drastic change I made was removing the Grouping concept that I had originally planned for. While I was implementing it, I realized that the code for Grouping and Labeling were very similar. Because of this, I ended up removing the Grouping concept and absorbing the functionality into the Labeling concept. Though this did save a lot of repetitive code, I might have kept Grouping as a separate concept if I had more time for a project with a larger scope, as I believe it is more intuitive to think about associating a set of users this way, and it would be easier to store data such as traits of the groupâ€™s users.
