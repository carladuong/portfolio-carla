# Assignment 2: Divergent Design

## Broad Application Goals

The goal of my app, which I have named **Ginger**, will be to create communities where people with disabilities and mental illnesses can engage in dialogue and support each other. Building a social media app with this audience in mind means that I can include more features that will make it helpful and accessible for them (a few that I had in mind are filtering posts/resources by location and a screen reader). Also, because the purpose of the app is to create a dedicated safe space for people with disabilities, users don't need to worry about having to interact with the inappropriate and harmful content that is difficult to avoid on similar, general-purpose social media apps.

## Scrapbook of Comparables

Subreddit homepages: Like Ginger, Reddit aims to create communities (Subreddits) for people with different interests. This screenshot shows the homepage of the MIT Subreddit, and I like that it includes a description of what the Subreddit is for as well as the rules. I might extend it to include more general resources, such as a blurb for people who are not part of the community to explain what they should know about it.

Adding a story to a location on Queering the Map: It could be helpful to have a map that users can contibute to by pinning local resources.

Private notes on Android notes app: While I would like communities to be publicly accessible so that curious allies can learn from them, I think it would also be helpful for users to be able to choose if they want posts to be visible only to members of the community they are posting to (extending the feature of notes that are only visible to yourself on the notes app).

![Screenshot of Poshmark](/../assets/images/poshmark_ss.jpg)
Categorizing and filtering listings on Poshmark: Most shopping apps, like Poshmark, categorize their items so that a user can choose what they want to look for. I want to apply a similar idea within communities on Ginger so that a user can select what kind of posts they want to look at (advice, stories, support, etc.).

![Screenshot of Tumblr](/../assets/images/tumblr-gif.gif)
Filtering out tags on Tumblr: Tumblr allows you to specify tags relating to content you don't want to view in the settings. I think it would be helpful to take this a step further and hide any posts that might contain the words that a user does not want to see. This could be particularly beneficial for users who might have triggers.

![Screenshot of Spotify](/../assets/images/spotify_ss.jpg)
Swiping to add a song to the queue on Spotify: Incorporating interactions like these for posts instead of songs could make the app more accessible for some people than closely spaced interaction buttons (e.g. like, save, share, etc.). I could even extend this by making a swipe in one direction result in a save, and the swipe in the other direction result in a like (or some other interaction).
