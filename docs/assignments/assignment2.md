# Assignment 2: Divergent Design

## Broad Application Goals

The goal of my app, which I have named **Ginger**, will be to create communities where people with disabilities and mental illnesses can engage in dialogue and support each other. Building a social media app with this audience in mind means that I can include more features that will make it helpful and accessible for them (a few that I had in mind are filtering posts/resources by location and a screen reader). Also, because the purpose of the app is to create a dedicated safe space for people with disabilities, users don't need to worry about having to interact with the inappropriate and harmful content that is difficult to avoid on similar, general-purpose social media apps.

## Scrapbook of Comparables

Subreddit homepages: Like Ginger, Reddit aims to create communities (Subreddits) for people with different interests. This screenshot shows the homepage of the MIT Subreddit, and I like that it includes a description of what the Subreddit is for as well as the rules. I might extend it to include more general resources, such as a blurb for people who are not part of the community to explain what they should know about it.

Adding a story to a location on Queering the Map: It could be helpful to have a map that users can contibute to by pinning local resources.

![Screenshot of Android Notes App](/../assets/images/android_notes_app_ss.jpg)
Private notes on Android notes app: While I would like communities to be publicly accessible so that curious allies can learn from them, I think it would also be helpful for users to be able to choose if they want posts to be visible only to members of the community they are posting to (extending the feature of notes that are only visible to yourself on the notes app).

![Screenshot of Poshmark](/../assets/images/poshmark_ss.jpg)
Categorizing and filtering listings on Poshmark: Most shopping apps, like Poshmark, categorize their items so that a user can choose what they want to look for. I want to apply a similar idea within communities on Ginger so that a user can select what kind of posts they want to look at (advice, stories, support, etc.).

![Screenshot of Tumblr](/../assets/images/tumblr-gif.gif)
Filtering out tags on Tumblr: Tumblr allows you to specify tags relating to content you don't want to view in the settings. I think it would be helpful to take this a step further and hide any posts that might contain the words that a user does not want to see. This could be particularly beneficial for users who might have triggers.

![Screenshot of Spotify](/../assets/images/spotify_ss.jpg)
Swiping to add a song to the queue on Spotify: Incorporating interactions like these for posts instead of songs could make the app more accessible for some people than closely spaced interaction buttons (e.g. like, save, share, etc.). I could even extend this by making a swipe in one direction result in a save, and the swipe in the other direction result in a like (or some other interaction).

## Feature Brainstorming
I came up with the first 14 features on this list. For the remaining ones, I used ChatGPT to help me by either asking for feature ideas that I expanded on, or by asking for potential problems with current social media apps that I then thought of solutions for.

1. **Symptom search**: Users can search for their symptoms and find community pages for disabilities or mental illnesses that might cause those symptoms. Although it is not a substitute for a diagnosis, finding people who have similar symptoms and experiences and learning how they cope could help those who don't have the resources to see a doctor.

2. **Community pages**: Community pages will display all of the posts related to a certain disability or mental illness. Like some other social media sites, a community page will include the rules of the community. It will also include general information about the condition it represents, such as a list of common symptoms. 

3. **Filtering by type of post**: Users can tag their posts with the type of post it is-- a story/experience, advice, vent, resource, etc. Within a community page, users can then filter posts using these tags in order to help them find resources that are helpful to them.

4. **Cross-posting**: Users can choose to post a certain post in more than one community. Many people have multiple illnesses whose symptoms intermingle and sometimes compound, so this can be helpful for someone who is looking for other people who have the same experience, or just for input from more than one community.

5. **Community-exclusive posts**: While communities are publicly accessible, a user can choose to make a certain post visible only to other members of the community. Although one benefit of this app is that is can be a great place for people without a certain disability to educate themselves, a community member sharing a vulnerable experience may want to limit a post's visibility to those most likely to understand them.

6. **Filtering by location**: Within a community page, a user can choose to view posts that are relevant to where they are (not all posts need to be tagged with a location, but posts about local resources can be). This could be a great way for people to find and recommmend qualified doctors or resource centers in their area.

7. **Resource map**: Users can add resources to a map that can be viewed by other users. These can be local resource centers, reputable doctors, safe and inclusive social spaces, and more. To make this easier, I'm hoping that by including information about a certain place at the time of making a post, this can be done automatically.

8. **Community badges**: The communities that a user is a member of will be displayed on their profile (unless they choose not to make this information public). Again, this could help people find and connect with others with the same chronic conditions as them.

9. **Safe browsing**: In their settings, a user can specify words relating to content that they don't want to see, and posts containing those words will hidden from them automatically. This is especially useful for people who have triggers. 

10. **Swipe to interact**: Instead of hitting the save or like buttons, users can swipe left on a post to save it and swipe right to like it if they prefer. People with certain disabilities may find it difficult to tap closely spaced buttons, so this could make it easier for them to use the app.

11. **Private profiles**: Aside from the communities that they are a part of, a user's identifying information will be hidden from people that they are not connected with. This is partly for safety (seeing as the app is more meant to connect with new people online rather than people that users already know in person) and partly for privacy (so that a user does not accidentally disclose their chronic condition to someone that they did not want to have that information, such as an employer).

12. **Chatting and common communities**: Users can start chats with other users, regardless of whether or not they are already connected. If User A wants to chat with User B and they are not already connected, a chat request on User B's end will show the communities that both User A and User B are apart of so they know what they have in common.

13. **Safe chat**: Since there are no rules in a chat the way that there are in a community, Ginger will detect if a message is inappropriate (e.g. it contains harmful or threatening language or a graphic image) and prevent the user from sending it for the recipient's safety.

14. **Buddy Matching**: Users can opt in to be matched with another person who has the same disability or disabilities as them. This is for those who might not need advice or resources, but just someone to talk with (but might have trouble reaching out).

15. **Event board**: Users can add both in-person and virtual events, such as support groups and social events, to an event board that other users can view. Users can filter these events to view both general events and events pertaining to their conditions. They can also filter to view local events.

16. **Text-to-speech and speech-to-text**: For those with motor or visual impairments, posts can be made by speaking rather than by typing, and existing posts can be played out loud.

17. **Resource library**: Each community page will also have a resource library. When users post about a resource, they can choose to also add it to the resource library so that it is not eventually lost in the community feed.

18. **Customizable font sizes and color schemes**: Users can change the display by adjusting the font size and the color scheme of the app, which I hope will make it more accessible to users with visual impairments.

19. **Hidden social info**: Unlike other social media apps, the number of connections that a user has will not be displayed on their profile. A cause of feelings of inadequacy and poor mental health on other social media apps is that other people are perceived as more successful, more important, or more well-liked. I would like all users to feel equally valued on my app, so I will remove this method of comparison.

20. **Resources for allies and loved ones**: Each community page will also have a section that contains information for people who don't have the chronic condition, but who want to educate themselves or support someone they know with it. It will include information about how to interact with the people in the community and resources that community members can add to.
